<h3 align="center" style="margin-top:48px; margin-bottom:24px">Projects & work:</h3>

- <b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Next Games: </a></b><italic><i>(In progress)</i> Video game catalog that uses the rawg.io API as a data source. In addition to displaying games from the API, the catalog also allows users to create and publish their own games. This project has been a great opportunity for me to learn Next.JS, as well as gain experience using Prisma ORM. Styling for the project is being implemented using Tailwind CSS, and all user-generated data is securely stored in a MySQL database.

- <b><a href="https://github.com/joagaloppo/ulock-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">uLock: </a></b> Web application designed to support content creators by allowing them to control access to their freely available content. Users who wish to download or view the content will be required to complete a social action, such as following the creator on a social network or sharing a post. This approach provides a way for creators to be compensated for their work while still allowing users to access content for free. I built it using React, Express, and Sequelize ORM with a MySQL database. During the development process I gained experience with user authentication and React Query.

- <b><a href="https://github.com/joagaloppo/budget-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Budget App: </a></b> Finance application that enables users to authenticate and manage their financial transactions efficiently. This app empowers users to track their expenses and incomes easily, and allows them to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on their transactions, with all the changes dynamically reflected on their personalized dashboard. Developed with React, Express, Passport.js, Sequelize ORM and PostgreSQL.

- <b><a href="https://github.com/joagaloppo/game-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Conway's Game of Life: </a></b> Dynamic React application that lets users interactively visualize the "Conway's Game of Life" algorithm. The app enables users to see how the algorithm works in real time.

- <b><a href="https://github.com/joagaloppo/videogames-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Videogames App:</a></b> Video game catalog with the same functionality as Next Games, but it was made with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL and pure CSS. This project was made as part of the final stage of the <a href="https://soyhenry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Henry</a> bootcamp I did back in 2022.

- <b><a href="https://github.com/joagaloppo/game-color-guess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Color Guess Game: </a></b> React  app that challenges users to identify a color given to them in hexadecimal format by selecting the corresponding color out of a set of N options. This project allowed me to enhance my skills with Material UI while creating an enjoyable user experience.
